# 2D Pixel RPG README

## Project Overview

This project, 2D Pixel RPG, is a top-down role-playing game where a player-controlled character shoots down incoming enemies. The game, currently in development for Android, boasts a simple and intuitive user interface, including joy-con sticks for movement and a dedicated shooting button. The game map consists of dynamically populated obstacles, adding layers of complexity to the gameplay.

## Changes since Midterm Report

The primary goal remains unchanged since the Midterm report - to create an immersive and interactive 2D Pixel RPG. However, there are a few changes to the user interface based on initial testing and feedback. The plan is to simplify the interface and streamline the user interactions, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Deliverables Completed

The following tasks have been successfully completed:

### Character
- **Movement**: The character can be moved using a virtual joystick for touch controls.

- **Collision**: The character can interact with (collide with) obstacles and mobs. Collision may lead to game termination.

### Mobs

## Pending Deliverables

The following tasks are yet to be completed:

### Mobs
- **Types**: The aim is to add various types of mobs with different abilities and behaviors.

### Obstacles
- **Types**: The plan is to introduce various types of obstacles that block movement and laser shots.

### Power-ups
- **Types**: The idea is to incorporate various power-ups to enhance the player's abilities (e.g., faster movement, more powerful lasers).
- **Spawn**: Power-ups should randomly spawn around the map.
- **Collection**: The player should be able to collect power-ups by moving their character over them.

### Scoring
- **Multipliers**: Plan to introduce score multipliers via power-ups or other game mechanics.

### Miscellaneous
- **Animations**: Character animations when moving in different directions are yet to be implemented.
- **Music**: Background music and sound effects (e.g., shooting lasers, enemy sounds, etc.) are in the pipeline.
- **Scene**: An options screen is yet to be developed. This screen would contain options to pause/resume the game, among other functionalities.

Please follow the updates for subsequent versions of the game as these features are added and improved.
